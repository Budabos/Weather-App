## Description of the Project
The "Weather Mood Checker" is a web application designed to enhance your daily mood and activities by providing weather-related insights and recommendations. In today's fast-paced world, understanding how weather conditions can affect our emotions and plans is essential. This project aims to bridge that gap by offering an intuitive and user-friendly solution.

## Key Features:

Real-Time Weather Data: The website utilizes up-to-date weather data to provide accurate information about current conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.

Mood Analysis: Using a unique algorithm, the website assesses the current weather conditions and generates mood suggestions based on the user's preferences and responses.

Location-Based Services: Users can access weather information and mood suggestions for their current location or any place of interest by entering the location's name or coordinates.

Personalized Recommendations: The "Weather Mood Checker" takes personal preferences into account, making tailored suggestions for outdoor activities, outfit choices, and more.

User-Friendly Interface: The user interface is designed with simplicity and clarity in mind, making it easy for users of all ages and backgrounds.

Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, ensuring an optimal user experience on various devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile.

API Integration: The project leverages reliable weather APIs to fetch data and ensures data accuracy and consistency.

Interactive Mood Journal: Users can log their moods based on the suggested activities and weather conditions, creating a personalized mood history.

## Project Setup
Create a GitHub Account:
Sign up for a GitHub account if you don't have one.
Log In to GitHub:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Go to Your Dashboard:

Navigate to your GitHub dashboard.
Create a New Repository:

Click "New" to create a new repository.
Fill in Repository Information:

Choose a name, description, visibility, and license.
Optionally initialize with a README file and select a .gitignore file.
Create the Repository:

Click "Create repository" to create it on GitHub.
Set Up Local Git Repository:

Initialize a Git repository locally, add and commit your files.
Set the remote repository URL to your GitHub repository.
Push your code to GitHub using git push.
Verify on GitHub:

Refresh your GitHub repository page to see your project files and commit history.
Your GitHub repository is now created and linked to your local project. You can continue to develop your project and use Git for version control.

## Usage:

The "Weather Mood Checker" is intended to improve people's daily lives by assisting them in making more informed decisions influenced by the weather. It is suitable for individuals seeking to maximize their well-being, plan their day effectively, or simply enjoy a more harmonious daily routine.

## Ninger API
Using the Ninjer API to build a weather app involves these steps:
Sign up for API access and get an API key.
Authenticate with your API key in your requests.
Use the appropriate API endpoint for weather data.
Make HTTP requests to retrieve weather data.
Handle API responses, typically in JSON format.
Implement error handling for issues like rate limits.
Display weather data in your app.
Update data as needed (e.g., periodic refresh).
Add app-specific features using weather data.
Ensure compliance with API terms of use.
Test and debug your app.
Provide user-friendly documentation.
Respect user privacy when collecting data.

## Technical Details:

The website is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with  Ninja API integration for real-time weather data. It also employs  front-end  to provide a seamless user experience.

## Project Requirements
Your app must be a HTML/CSS/JS/Bootstrap or Tailwind frontend that accesses data from a public API. All interactions between the client and the API should be handled asynchronously and use JSON as the communication format.

Your entire app must run on a single page. There should be NO redirects. In other words, your project will contain a single HTML file.

Your app needs to incorporate at least 3 separate event listeners (DOMContentLoaded, click, change, submit, etc).

Some interactivity is required. This could be as simple as adding a "like" button or adding comments. These interactions do not need to persist after reloading the page.

Follow good coding practices. Keep your code DRY (Do not repeat yourself) by utilizing functions to abstract repetitive code.

Stretch Goals
Use json-serverLinks to an external site. in your project to persist your app's interactivity.
Strategy, Timeline, and Tips
Planning
Plan out your features
Develop user stories
“As [ a user ], I want [ to perform this action ] so that [ I can accomplish this goal ].”
Features should not need you there to explain them to users
Plan out the structure of your JSON requests
Project Pitches
Before you start working on your project, you'll pitch your project idea to your instructors for approval and feedback.

For your project pitch, you should include:

The basic story of your application
The core features of your MVP
The API data you'll be using and how you'll use it
Challenges you expect to face
How you are meeting the requirements of the project
Feel free to send this pitch to your instructor via slack asynchronously.

MVP ASAP
Build a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) as quickly as possible.
Pick an API and explore it early on to ensure it will work for your need
Instructor Guidance
You should strive to solve problems independently, but you also shouldn't waste your time stuck on a problem. A good guideline for a small bug is the rule of 10s:

10 minutes debugging the code
10 minutes using Google and StackOverflow to try to find an answer
10 minutes asking your fellow students for help
Asking an instructor
If you seek out instructor guidance on your design from the start, they might help steer you into design and architectural decisions that will help you down the road. That will also give the instructors context for what your app is supposed to do, so you won't need to explain everything to them when asking for help debugging.

Guidelines for Staying Organized
Write down the decisions you make about your project. This will not only help you think more clearly, it will also help you communicate your project to instructors when asking for help. In addition to writing everything down, we also recommend the following to help stay organized and on track:

Describe/sketch your ideas (use diagrams!).
Start by creating a frontend directory with the basic files you'll need
Next, build enough code to get some API data to work with. Don't worry about building all of your async code yet, just get to the point where you can access one endpoint on an API, then start working on getting that data displayed.
Then, continue to build additional async code and frontend features.
Continue building features one by one.
Check in with your instructors to make sure your scope and timeline are manageable.

JSON Server Instructions
Note: Using json-server is a stretch goal, so make sure you have a working MVP before trying to set up json-server!

You can use this json-server templateLinks to an external site. to generate your backend code. Using this template will make it easier to deploy your backend later on.

If you prefer, instead of using the template, you can create a db.json file with a structure in the root of your project that looks like this:

{
  "toys": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Woody",
      "image": "http://www.pngmart.com/files/3/Toy-Story-Woody-PNG-Photos.png",
      "likes": 8
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "name": "Buzz Lightyear",
      "image": "http://www.pngmart.com/files/6/Buzz-Lightyear-PNG-Transparent-Picture.png",
      "likes": 14
    }
  ]
}
Then, assuming you have json-server installed globally, you can run this command to run the server:

 json-server --watch db.json
Whatever top-level keys exist in your db.json file will determine the routes available. In the example above, since we have a key of toys pointing to an array of toy objects, json-server will generate the following routes:

GET /toys
POST /toys
GET /toys/:id
PATCH /toys/:id
DELETE /toys/:id
